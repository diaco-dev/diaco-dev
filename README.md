<h2 align="center">Backend Developer ⚡ Crafting high-performance APIs & smart automation tools
</h2>


### 💻 About Me– Ario H.Abbadi

- 🧠 Backend Enthusiast
     I’ve always been fascinated by the behind-the-scenes of software, where the core architecture of systems and the heart of a project are formed. This passion led me to backend development, focusing on system structure and logic.
- ⚡ Clean & Efficient Code Lover
  More than anything, I enjoy designing clean, reliable APIs and optimizing system performance. It’s important to me that the code I write is both fast and maintainable.

- 🤖 Automation & Smart Tools
  Beyond web development, I’m deeply interested in automation and building practical assistants—tools that make daily tasks or complex processes smarter and simpler. This curiosity drives me to continuously learn and develop precise, efficient APIs.
